# NEOGames
The idea of this repository is create simple games inside the NEO blockchain.
It can be done in any language avaiable and the **ONLY** thing offchain is the interface, everything else must be inside the Network.
I don't like to think in games inside the blockchain that only uses the database to store information, i'd like to think in games that can be played inside the chain even without the interface.
